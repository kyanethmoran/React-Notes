      <h2>Lifting State Up: Data from Child to Parent</h2>

      <p>
        "Lifting state up" is a design pattern in component-based UI frameworks
        like React and Flutter, used to manage and share state between multiple
        components. It involves moving the state that is shared or manipulated
        by several child components to their closest common ancestor (parent
        component).
